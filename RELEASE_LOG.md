Chronological release notes for tagged wikitool versions.

## v0.2.0

Date: 2026-03-18

Breaking release that replaces the retrieval layer with a purpose-built knowledge system for AI-assisted authoring.

### What changed

The core idea: wikitool's local index should give an AI agent everything it needs to write a good wiki article in one call. v0.1.0 had the raw materials — page chunks, template data, link graphs — but left the agent to assemble them. v0.2.0 introduces `knowledge article-start`, which interprets those materials into an opinionated authoring brief: which sections comparable articles use, which templates and categories apply, what type of subject this is, and where the evidence gaps are.

### Breaking changes

- **Database reset required.** The knowledge index schema is incompatible with v0.1.0. Delete `.wikitool/data/wikitool.db` and rebuild with `wikitool pull --full --all && wikitool knowledge warm --docs-profile remilia-mw-1.44`.
- **Removed commands:** `workflow ask`, `workflow authoring-pack`, `db sync`, `index rebuild`. Use `knowledge article-start`, `knowledge pack`, and `knowledge build` respectively.
- **Skill surface collapsed.** Nine Claude skills reduced to two: `/wikitool` (operator) and `/review` (content gate). The old skill names no longer resolve.

### New capabilities

**`knowledge article-start`** — The authoring front door. Returns an interpreted brief with:
- Section skeleton derived from comparable page structures, with `content_backed` flags indicating which sections have evidence in the retrieval pack and which need further research
- Subject type hints inferred from infobox usage across comparables
- Template, category, and link surfaces scoped to what similar articles actually use
- Hard constraints from the wiki's profile overlay
- Suggested next actions

**`knowledge build` / `warm` / `status` / `pack`** — Explicit knowledge lifecycle. `warm` builds the content index and hydrates a docs profile in one pass. `status` reports readiness and degradations so agents can tell the difference between missing content, missing docs, and a fully warmed corpus.

**`research search` / `research fetch`** — External evidence layer. Search the live wiki API and fetch URLs with structured metadata extraction.

**`article lint` / `article fix`** — Wiki-aware draft quality loop. Catches missing short descriptions, citation placement issues, heading case, and structural problems. `fix --apply safe` auto-corrects mechanical issues.

**`wiki profile sync` / `show`** — Live capability inspection. Exposes installed extensions, configured namespaces, and the active Remilia overlay.

**`templates show` / `examples`** — Template catalog. Shows parameters, usage stats, documentation, implementation pages, and real usage examples from the indexed content.

### Improvements

- Section skeleton now extracts headings directly from comparable pages via the content index, rather than relying on whatever headings happened to appear in retrieved chunks. Skeletons for well-covered topics went from 2 sections (Overview + References) to 5-8 meaningful sections.
- Every top-level CLI command now has a help description.
- Agent guidance (`article_structure.md`, `writing_guide.md`) updated to document skeleton interpretation: use as starting point, drop inapplicable sections, investigate `content_backed: false` gaps with `inspect chunks`.
- Retrieval internals split from a monolithic module into focused subsystems: content indexing, references, templates, retrieval, authoring, docs bridge, status.
- Knowledge artifacts are manifest-backed with schema generation tracking, so stale indexes are detected rather than silently degraded.
- Docs bridge enriches authoring retrieval with pinned MediaWiki 1.44 documentation, blending "how MediaWiki says it works" with "how this wiki uses it."
- 146 unit tests (up from 78). CLI regression testbench and acceptance workflow harness expanded.
