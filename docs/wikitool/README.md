# Wikitool Documentation (Diataxis)

This folder follows the Diataxis model so editors and agents can find the right type of guidance quickly.

## Contents

- `SETUP.md` - step-by-step setup for new editors
- `how-to.md` - task-focused recipes (sync, validation, imports, perf checks)
- `reference.md` - comprehensive command/flag reference (canonical, keep in sync with CLI)
- `explanation.md` - architecture and design rationale

If you need a single source of truth for commands and flags, use `docs/wikitool/reference.md`.
