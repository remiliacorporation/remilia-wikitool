Describes the subject, not the article. No wikitext inside. |\n| 2 | `{{Article quality\\|unverified}}` | Mandatory for AI-generated content. Never use `wip` or `verified`. |\n| 3 | *(blank)* | |\n| 4+ | `\u0027\u0027\u0027Bold Title\u0027\u0027\u0027` opening paragraph | First sentence defines the subject.

Common patterns:\n\n| Subject type | Typical sections |\n|---|---|\n| Person | History, Career, Notable work, Personal life |\n| Organization | History, Projects, Structure, Impact |\n| Concept | Origin, Description, Usage, Reception |\n| NFT Collection | Development, Launch, Design, Community, Impact |\n| Event | Background, The event, Aftermath |\n| Artwork | Creation, Description, Exhibition, Reception |\n\n### Section rules\n- Use `==` for main sections, `===` for subsections.\n- Sentence case: `== Early life ==` not `== Early Life ==`.\n- One blank line before each heading.\n- Do not number sections or phrase them as questions.\n\n## Standard appendices (in this order)\n\n```wikitext\n== See also ==\n* [[Related Article 1]]\n* [[Related Article 2]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://example.com Official website]\n\n[[Category:Remilia]]\n[[Category:NFT Collections]]\n```\n\n### See also\n- 3-5 links to related articles not already prominently linked in the body.\n- Only link to pages that exist. Never add red links here.\n\n### References\n- `{{Reflist}}` renders all inline `\u003cref\u003e` citations.\n- This section is mandatory if the article has any citations.\n\n### Further reading (optional)\n- Relevant publications not used as sources. Be selective.\n\n### External links (optional)\n- Official websites, major resources. Typically 1-3 links maximum.\n- For NFT collections, include `{{Etherscan}}` with the contract address.\n\n### Categories\n- 2-4 categories from the wiki\u0027s existing category set.\n- Place at the very end of the article, after all sections.\n- Look up valid categories: `bun run wikitool search --categories`\n\n## Content extension tags\n\nUse these when the article calls for special content:\n\n```wikitext\n\u003cmath\u003eE = mc^2\u003c/math\u003e                                    \u003c!-- Math formulas --\u003e\n\u003csyntaxhighlight lang=\"solidity\"\u003ecode\u003c/syntaxhighlight\u003e  \u003c!-- Source code --\u003e\n\u003cpoem\u003eLine 1\\nLine 2\u003c/poem\u003e                               \u003c!-- Poetry/lyrics --\u003e\n{{#ev:youtube|VIDEO_ID|description=Caption}}              \u003c!-- Video embeds --\u003e\n\u003ctabber\u003e\n|-|Tab 1=Content\n|-|Tab 2=Content\n\u003c/tabber\u003e                                                 \u003c!-- Tabbed content --\u003e\n```\n\nSee `extensions.md` for full details on each.\n",

Violating them produces text that reads as machine-generated.\n\n---\n\n## I. Banned phrases and constructions\n\n### Significance inflation\n\nNever attach importance-claims to mundane facts. State what happened; let the reader judge significance.\n\n**Never use:**\n- \"stands as\", \"serves as a testament\", \"is a testament to\"\n- \"pivotal role\", \"crucial role\", \"significant role\", \"key role\"\n- \"key moment\", \"key turning point\", \"watershed moment\"\n- \"underscores its importance\", \"highlights its significance\"\n- \"reflects broader trends\", \"reflects the evolving\"\n- \"symbolizing its ongoing\", \"enduring legacy\", \"lasting impact\"\n- \"contributing to the\", \"setting the stage for\"\n- \"marking/shaping the\", \"represents a shift\", \"marks a shift\"\n- \"evolving landscape\", \"cultural landscape\"\n- \"focal point\", \"indelible mark\", \"deeply rooted\"\n- \"profound heritage\", \"rich history\"\n\n**Instead:** State specific facts. \"The collection sold 10,000 units in 48 hours\" is better than \"The collection played a pivotal role in shaping the evolving NFT landscape.\"\n\n### Promotional puffery\n\n**Never use:**\n- \"rich tapestry\", \"vibrant tapestry\", \"diverse tapestry\"\n- \"groundbreaking\", \"revolutionary\", \"trailblazing\"\n- \"stunning\", \"breathtaking\", \"fascinating glimpse\"\n- \"boasts a\", \"continues to captivate\"\n- \"nestled in\", \"in the heart of\"\n- \"intricate\", \"robust\", \"comprehensive\" (when vague)\n- \"innovative\", \"cutting-edge\"\n\n### Copula avoidance\n\nAI text systematically avoids \"is/are/was/has\" in favor of elaborate substitutions. Use the simple form.\n\n| Bad (AI pattern) | Good (natural) |\n|---|---|\n| serves as the headquarters | is the headquarters |\n| features a collection of | has a collection of |\n| boasts a population of | has a population of |\n| marks the beginning of | is the beginning of |\n| stands as an example of | is an example of |\n| represents a departure from | is a departure from |\n| offers a glimpse into | shows |\n| ventured into politics as | was a candidate |\n\n### AI vocabulary (statistically overused)\n\nThese words appear at dramatically higher rates in AI text than in human writing. Any single use may be fine, but clustering them is a strong AI signal.\n\n**Watch list — use sparingly or not at all:**\n- additionally, furthermore, moreover, notably\n- particularly, specifically, essentially, fundamentally\n- multifaceted, comprehensive, intricate, nuanced\n- landscape, tapestry, realm, sphere\n- leverage, harness, foster, facilitate\n- delve, underscore, showcase, highlight\n- testament, cornerstone, hallmark\n- encompasses, embodies, encapsulates\n- commendable, noteworthy, remarkable\n\n**Prefer instead:** plain connectives (and, but, also, however), concrete verbs, specific nouns.\n\n### Didactic disclaimers\n\n**Never use:**\n- \"it\u0027s important to note\", \"it should be noted\"\n- \"it is crucial to differentiate\", \"it is worth mentioning\"\n- \"it\u0027s important to remember\"\n- \"may vary\", \"results may differ\"\n- \"it is beyond the scope of\"\n\nThese address the reader directly. Encyclopedic prose never does this.\n\n### Section summaries and conclusions\n\n**Never:**\n- Add a \"Conclusion\" section\n- End sections with \"In summary,\" / \"In conclusion,\" / \"Overall,\"\n- Restate a section\u0027s main point at its end\n- Add a \"Challenges and future outlook\" section using the formula: \"Despite its [positive words], [subject] faces challenges...\"\n\nSections should end with the last relevant fact, not a wrap-up.\n\n### Elegant variation\n\nDo not strain to find synonyms for the subject. Repeating the name or using \"it/they\" is better than cycling through \"the project\", \"the collection\", \"the initiative\", \"the venture\".\n\n**Bad:** \"Milady Maker launched in 2021. The collection... The project... The PFP initiative...\"\n**Good:** \"Milady Maker launched in 2021. It... The collection...\" (pick one and stay consistent)\n\n### False ranges\n\nOnly use \"from X to Y\" when X and Y sit on a real, identifiable scale (time, quantity, severity).\n\n**Bad:** \"from problem-solving to artistic expression\" (no scale)\n**Bad:** \"from fundamental physics to medicine\" (different fields, not a range)\n**Good:** \"from 2019 to 2023\" (time scale)\n**Good:** \"from mild to severe\" (severity scale)\n\n### Negative parallelisms\n\n**Never use argumentative constructions:**\n- \"Not only X, but also Y\"\n- \"It is not just about X, it\u0027s about Y\"\n- \"No mere X, but a Y\"\n\nThese are persuasive, not encyclopedic. State both facts plainly.\n\n### Rule of three\n\nDo not artificially group items in threes for rhetorical effect.\n\n**Bad:** \"keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities\"\n**Good:** Name the specific sessions, or describe what happened.\n\n### Superficial analysis via participle phrases\n\nDo not attach \"-ing\" phrases that assign significance to facts.\n\n**Bad:** \"The exhibition opened in March, highlighting the growing interest in digital art.\"\n**Bad:** \"The project launched on Ethereum, showcasing the possibilities of on-chain art.\"\n**Good:** \"The exhibition opened in March.\" (Let the reader draw conclusions.)\n\n### Notability name-dropping\n\nDo not invoke famous names or projects to inflate a subject\u0027s significance by association.\n\n**Bad:** \"reminiscent of Beeple\u0027s Everydays\", \"akin to what Banksy achieved\", \"in the tradition of CryptoPunks\"\n**Good:** Describe the subject\u0027s own qualities. Comparisons require sourcing — if a reliable source drew the comparison, cite it. Otherwise omit.\n\n### Inline-header lists\n\nDo not use `**Header:** description` pseudo-list patterns. This is a strong AI signal — it tries to impose structure without using actual sections.\n\n**Bad:**\n```\n**Artistic style:** The collection features anime-inspired aesthetics.\n**Community:** Holders participate in group chats.\n**Market performance:** The floor price rose in 2023.\n```\n\n**Good:** Write these as flowing prose paragraphs, or use proper `===` subsections if they genuinely warrant their own headings.\n\n### Excessive hedging\n\nDo not over-qualify every statement. State the fact or omit it.\n\n**Never use:**\n- \"arguably\", \"potentially\", \"to some extent\"\n- \"in many ways\", \"in some respects\", \"it could be said that\"\n- \"one might argue\", \"it remains to be seen\"\n\nThese weaken the prose and signal uncertainty about your own output. Encyclopedic writing states what is known and attributes contested claims to sources.\n\n---\n\n## II. Prose style\n\n### Vary sentence rhythm\n- Mix short sentences with longer ones. Monotonous medium-length sentences are an AI signal.\n- A two-word sentence after a long one creates emphasis. Three long sentences in a row feel mechanical.\n- Read your output aloud (mentally) — if it sounds like a metronome, rewrite.\n\n### Write plainly\n- Prefer active voice. \"Remilia launched the collection\" not \"The collection was launched by Remilia.\"\n- Use concrete verbs: \"sold\", \"created\", \"published\", \"wrote\" — not \"leveraged\", \"facilitated\", \"showcased\".\n\n### Lead section\n- The lead summarizes the entire article in 1-4 paragraphs.\n- The first sentence defines the subject: **\u0027\u0027\u0027Subject\u0027\u0027\u0027** is/was [definition].\n- The lead should stand alone as a useful summary.\n- Do not add citations to the lead if the same facts are cited in the body.\n\n### Flowing prose over lists\n- Write paragraphs, not bullet points. Lists are for genuinely discrete items (tracklists, member rosters, dates).\n- **Bad:** Converting three related facts into a three-item bullet list.\n- **Good:** \"The project\u0027s goals are to document history, create a community, and provide accurate information.\"\n\n### Consistent terminology\n- Pick one term for a concept and use it throughout. Don\u0027t alternate between \"the project\", \"the collection\", \"the initiative\" for the same thing.\n- Use the subject\u0027s actual name, not elegant variations.\n\n### Sentence case for headings\n- `== Early life and education ==` (correct)\n- `== Early Life and Education ==` (wrong — title case)\n- Exception: proper nouns within headings retain their capitalization.\n\n### No direct address\n- Never address \"you\" or \"the reader\".\n- Never use \"we\" to mean \"you and I, the reader\".\n- Third person only.\n\n---\n\n## III. Formatting and markup\n\n### Wikitext, not Markdown\n- `\u0027\u0027\u0027bold\u0027\u0027\u0027` not `**bold**`\n- `\u0027\u0027italic\u0027\u0027` not `*italic*`\n- `== Heading ==` not `## Heading`\n- `[[Link]]` not `[Link](url)`\n- `----` not `---`\n- Never output fenced code blocks (` ```wikitext `)\n\n### Straight quotes only\n- Use `\"` and `\u0027` (straight), never `\"` `\"` `\u0027` `\u0027` (curly).\n- This applies to all text including quotations.\n\n### Bold usage\n- Bold the article title in the first sentence only: `\u0027\u0027\u0027Milady Maker\u0027\u0027\u0027 is...`\n- Never use bold for emphasis in the body. Use italics sparingly, or rewrite.\n\n### Dashes\n- Use em dashes (—) sparingly. Commas, parentheses, or colons are often better.\n- Never cluster multiple em dashes in a paragraph.\n\n### Citations after punctuation\n- **Correct:** `...the event occurred.\u003cref\u003e{{Cite web|...}}\u003c/ref\u003e`\n- **Wrong:** `...the event occurred\u003cref\u003e{{Cite web|...}}\u003c/ref\u003e.`\n\n### Non-English text\n- Mark non-English words with `{{lang|xx|word}}` where xx is the ISO 639 language code.\n- Proper names in other languages typically don\u0027t need this.\n\n### Images and infoboxes\n- Place infoboxes and lead images right-aligned.\n- Use `|thumb|right|` for article images.\n- Write descriptive captions — they appear in popups and previews.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Citation hygiene\n\n### Never fabricate sources\n- Every URL, DOI, and ISBN must be real and verifiable.\n- If you cannot find a source, do not make the claim.\n- Never invent reference details to fill gaps.\n\n### No URL trackers\n- Strip `?utm_source=chatgpt.com`, `?utm_source=openai`, `?referrer=grok.com` and similar tracking parameters from all URLs.\n\n### No placeholder content\n- Never output: `[Author Name]`, `INSERT_SOURCE_URL`, `2025-XX-XX`, `https://www.example.com/source`\n- If information is unavailable, omit the field entirely.\n\n### No system artifacts\n- Never output: `citeturn0search0`, `contentReference[oaicite:0]`, `oai_citation`, `({\"attribution\":{\"attributableIndex\":\"...\"}})`, `attached_file:1`\n- Never output `[cite_start]`, `[cite: N]`, or similar citation markers from training data.\n\n### Named references for reuse\n- First use: `\u003cref name=\"shortname\"\u003e{{Cite web|...}}\u003c/ref\u003e`\n- Subsequent: `\u003cref name=\"shortname\" /\u003e`\n- Never duplicate the full citation. Never declare named refs inside `{{Reflist}}`.\n\n### Access dates\n- Use today\u0027s date for `access-date`, not a date from weeks or months ago.\n- All citations in one article should have consistent, current access dates.\n\n### Archive fields\n- Leave ALL archive fields blank: `archive-url`, `archive-is`, `archive-date`, `screenshot`.\n- Human editors complete these manually later.\n\n### Citation density\n- Aim for 2-5 citations in a short article (2-4 paragraphs).\n- Cite specific claims about the subject, not general background.\n- **Bad:** \"NFTs are digital tokens.\u003cref\u003e1\u003c/ref\u003e They are recorded on blockchains.\u003cref\u003e2\u003c/ref\u003e\"\n- **Good:** \"NFTs are digital tokens recorded on blockchains. Milady Maker launched in August 2021.\u003cref\u003e1\u003c/ref\u003e\"\n\n---\n\n## V. Meta-communication\n\n### Never talk about the task\n- No \"Certainly!\", \"Here\u0027s a draft...\", \"I hope this helps\", \"Let me know if...\"\n- No \"In this article, we will discuss...\"\n- No \"As an AI language model...\"\n\n### Never mention knowledge limitations\n- No \"as of my last knowledge update\", \"based on available information\"\n- No \"details aren\u0027t widely documented\", \"is limited in the provided search results\"\n- No speculation about gaps in sources.\n\n### Never include reviewer notes\n- No submission statements explaining why the article is notable.\n- No notes to editors about what to check.\n- Output only the article wikitext, nothing else.\n\n---\n\n## VI. Unreliable sources\n\n**Never cite these — they appear in search results but are unreliable:**\n- IQ.wiki (iq.wiki) — inaccurate, user-generated\n- Know Your Meme (knowyourmeme.com) — tertiary source, quality issues\n- NFT Price Floor (nftpricefloor.com) — inaccurate details\n- Urban Dictionary (urbandictionary.com) — unmoderated, unverifiable\n\nIf these are the only sources available, note the lack of reliable sourcing rather than citing them.\n\n---\n\n## VII. Quick self-check\n\nBefore finishing any article, verify:\n\n1. **No banned phrases** — search your output for \"tapestry\", \"landscape\", \"pivotal\", \"testament\", \"showcasing\", \"underscores\", \"highlights\"\n2. **Simple copulas** — did you use \"is/was/has\" or always avoid them?\n3. **No section summaries** — does any section end with a restatement?\n4. **Sentence case headings** — are all headings sentence case?\n5. **Straight quotes** — any curly quotes?\n6. **Clean citations** — any utm_source, placeholder dates, or fabricated URLs?\n7. **No meta-commentary** — does output contain only article wikitext?\n8. **Prose, not lists** — did you convert anything to bullets that should be prose?\n9. **Sentence rhythm** — are your sentences monotonously similar in length? Mix short and long.\n10. **No name-dropping** — did you invoke famous names just for association?\n11. **No hedging** — any \"arguably\", \"potentially\", \"to some extent\"?\n",

                                            "content":  "# Remilia Wiki — Writing Guide\n\nYou create encyclopedic articles for a MediaWiki wiki about Remilia Corporation, Milady Maker, and the network spirituality ecosystem.\n\n**Wiki:** https://wiki.remilia.org\n**Stack:** MediaWiki 1.44 with Lua templates, Cargo structured data, CirrusSearch\n\nThis guide is the primary reference. Read `style_rules.md` before every article.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Output format\n\nAll output must be raw MediaWiki wikitext, ready for direct use on the wiki. Never output Markdown. Never wrap output in code blocks. Never include commentary or meta-text — only article wikitext.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Article workflow\n\n### Writing a new article\n\n1. **Research the topic** — search the web for reliable sources. Check the live wiki for existing content and related articles to link.\n2. **Read `style_rules.md`** — internalize the antipatterns before writing.\n3. **Look up templates** — use `bun run wikitool context --template \"Template Name\"` to see parameters for any template. See section 6 for common infobox mappings.\n4. **Write the article** following the structure in `article_structure.md`.\n5. **Self-check** against the quick checklist at the end of `style_rules.md`.\n6. **Save** to `wiki_content/Main/{Article_Title}.wiki`.\n7. **Validate** — run `bun run wikitool validate \"Article Title\"` to catch structural issues.\n\n### Editing an existing article\n\n1. Pull latest: `bun run wikitool pull`\n2. Read the existing article.\n3. Make changes following all the same rules.\n4. Validate: `bun run wikitool validate \"Article Title\"`\n5. Review: `bun run wikitool diff`\n6. Push: `bun run wikitool push --dry-run -s \"Summary\"` then `bun run wikitool push -s \"Summary\"`\n\n### Article length\n\nLet content dictate length — don\u0027t pad thin topics or compress rich ones.\n\n- **Stub** (1-2 paragraphs): acceptable for minor topics with limited sources\n- **Short** (3-5 paragraphs + infobox): most articles\n- **Medium** (8-15 paragraphs): major topics like Milady Maker, Remilia Corporation\n- **Long** (15+ paragraphs): rare, reserved for flagship articles with deep sourcing\n\n---\n\n## 3. Research and sources\n\n### This is a subcultural wiki, not an academic journal\n\nThis is the most important sourcing principle. Excessive academic citations are a telltale sign of AI writing. Prefer primary sources over academic papers.\n\n**Good sources:**\n- Official announcements, blog posts, project websites\n- Tweets and social media posts (primary sources)\n- News articles from established outlets\n- Interviews and podcasts\n- On-chain data (Etherscan, OpenSea)\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Academic journals (unless the claim is itself academic)\n- Anonymous forum posts (unless notable in context)\n- Unverified rumors\n- Paywalled content you can\u0027t verify\n\n**Never cite:**\n- IQ.wiki — unreliable, user-generated\n- Know Your Meme — tertiary source, quality issues\n- NFT Price Floor — inaccurate details\n- Urban Dictionary — unmoderated, unverifiable\n\n### Tone calibration\n\nThis is a subcultural wiki, not an academic journal. The tone should be encyclopedic but not dry or clinical. Match the register of good Wikipedia articles about internet culture — factual, clear, and willing to engage with cultural context without editorializing. Humor and irreverence are fine when sourced; promotional enthusiasm and clinical detachment are both wrong.\n\n### Never fabricate\n\nNever fabricate facts, dates, quotes, or source URLs. If a specific detail cannot be found, omit it rather than guessing. Mark uncertain claims with attribution: \"According to [source]...\" rather than asserting directly. Every URL and date in a citation must be real and verifiable.\n\n### Verified wiki articles\n\nArticles marked `{{Article quality|verified}}` represent editor-approved content. Use them to:\n- Define project-specific terminology consistently\n- Ensure consistent internal linking (`[[Remilia Corporation]]`, `[[Milady Maker]]`)\n- Follow established formatting patterns\n\n### When to search vs. when to write from knowledge\n\n**Must search (cite the source):**\n- Specific dates, events, names, actions\n- Direct quotations\n- Controversial or surprising claims\n- Statistics, numbers, data points\n- Reception and impact claims\n\n**May write without searching (no citation needed):**\n- Common knowledge: \"NFTs are digital tokens recorded on blockchains\"\n- General background: \"online communities often develop distinctive aesthetics\"\n- Technical context: \"smart contracts execute automatically\"\n- Historical context: \"the early internet fostered pseudonymous communities\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. Citation strategy\n\n### Target density\n\n- **Short article (2-4 paragraphs):** 2-5 citations\n- **Medium article (5-10 paragraphs):** 5-10 citations\n- **Long article:** proportionally more, but never cite every sentence\n\nFocus citations on the claims that matter most. Let general context breathe without citations.\n\n### Citation templates\n\n```wikitext\n{{Cite web|url=|title=|author=|date=|access-date=2026-02-13|website=}}\n{{Cite tweet|user=|number=|title=|date=}}\n{{Cite news|url=|title=|author=|date=|access-date=2026-02-13|work=}}\n{{Cite post|url=|title=|author=|date=|access-date=2026-02-13}}\n{{Cite video|url=|title=|author=|date=|access-date=2026-02-13}}\n```\n\n- Fill in all available fields. Leave unknown fields empty (omit them).\n- **Always leave archive fields blank** (`archive-url`, `archive-is`, `archive-date`, `screenshot`) — human editors complete these.\n- Use `access-date` of today\u0027s date.\n\n### Named references\n\nWhen citing the same source multiple times:\n\n```wikitext\nFirst use: \u003cref name=\"fang2023\"\u003e{{Cite web|...}}\u003c/ref\u003e\nLater:     \u003cref name=\"fang2023\" /\u003e\n```\n\nName conventions: `author+year` format, lowercase, no spaces. For multiple works by the same author in the same year: `fang2023a`, `fang2023b`.\n\nNever duplicate full citations. Never declare named refs inside `{{Reflist}}`.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Content rules\n\n### Remilia-specific\n\n- **Attribution:** For Remilia projects, use `parent_group = Remilia` in infoboxes instead of `creator` or `artist` fields. Discuss individual contributors in the article body. This honors post-authorship principles.\n- **Charlotte Fang:** Relevant but don\u0027t relate everything back to her. Use \"Remilia\" or \"Remilia Corporation\" as the subject unless specifically quoting her or discussing actions directly attributed to her.\n- **Terminology:** Use terms as established in verified wiki articles (e.g., \"network spirituality\", not \"digital spirituality\").\n\n### Internal linking\n\n- Link to existing wiki articles on first mention in the body: `[[Remilia Corporation]]`, `[[Milady Maker]]`\n- Link each article once — first occurrence only, don\u0027t re-link in later paragraphs\n- Check if target exists: `bun run wikitool search \"Article Name\"`\n- Never place red links in See also sections\n- Use piped links when display text differs: `[[Remilia Corporation|Remilia]]`\n\n### Quality marking\n\nEvery AI-generated article must include `{{Article quality|unverified}}` on line 2. Only human editors may change this to `wip` or `verified`. Never output `{{Article quality|wip}}` or `{{Article quality|verified}}`.\n\n### Categories\n\nCategories are managed via the wiki database. To find valid categories:\n\n```bash\nbun run wikitool search --categories          # List all categories\nbun run wikitool search -c \"Category:Name\"    # Search specific category\n```\n\nGeneral rules:\n- Use 2-4 categories per article\n- `[[Category:Remilia]]` goes on all Remilia-related content\n- Choose the most specific applicable category\n- Never invent categories — use only those that exist on the wiki\n\n---\n\n## 6. Infobox selection\n\n| Subject type | Infobox |\n|---|---|\n| Person | `{{Infobox person}}` |\n| Organization/Group | `{{Infobox organization}}` |\n| NFT Collection | `{{Infobox NFT collection}}` |\n| Artwork | `{{Infobox artwork}}` |\n| Website/Platform | `{{Infobox website}}` |\n| Concept/Philosophy | `{{Infobox concept}}` |\n| Exhibition | `{{Infobox exhibition}}` |\n| General/Other | `{{Infobox subject}}` |\n\nTo see all parameters for any template:\n\n```bash\nbun run wikitool context --template \"Infobox person\"\nbun run wikitool context --template \"Cite web\"\n```\n\nThis queries the live database, so it always reflects current template capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Looking up templates and extensions\n\n### Template parameters\n\nUse wikitool to query template parameters from the database:\n\n```bash\nbun run wikitool context --template \"Template Name\"   # Show params + usage stats\nbun run wikitool search \"infobox\"                      # Find templates by name\n```\n\nThis is always authoritative — it reflects what\u0027s actually deployed on the wiki.\n\n### Extension documentation\n\nExtension docs are imported from mediawiki.org and searched locally:\n\n```bash\nbun run wikitool docs search \"embed video\"             # Search imported docs\nbun run wikitool docs list                              # List all imported docs\nbun run wikitool docs import ExtensionName              # Import new extension docs\nbun run wikitool docs update                            # Refresh all imported docs\n```\n\nSee `extensions.md` for a quick reference of the most-used content tags.\n\n### Categories\n\n```bash\nbun run wikitool search \"Category:\"                    # Browse categories\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Reference files\n\n| File | Purpose | When to read |\n|---|---|---|\n| `style_rules.md` | Natural writing antipatterns | **Before every article** |\n| `article_structure.md` | Structural template | Before writing new articles |\n| `extensions.md` | Quick reference for content extension tags | When using math, code, video, tabs |\n\nFor template parameters and categories, always use wikitool live lookups rather than static files.\n",
