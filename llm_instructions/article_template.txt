[AI: Select the most appropriate infobox template for the subject (e.g., {{Infobox person}}, {{Infobox organization}}, {{Infobox NFT collection}}). Fill in its parameters using data cited in the article body. For Remilia projects, use parent_group instead of creator fields.]

'''[Article Subject]''' is [opening sentence defining the subject in bold, providing context].<ref>[Citation if this is a specific claim about the subject requiring verification.]</ref> [Second sentence expanding on significance or key identifying information.] [Third sentence providing historical context or contemporary relevance.]

[Second paragraph expanding on the opening. The lead section should summarize information that is covered in detail in the article body. Lead paragraphs do not require citations if the information is cited later in the body.]

[AI: Adapt the following section structure to fit your subject. Not every article needs all these sections. Choose sections that make sense for what you're documenting.]

[AI: Common section patterns by subject type:
- People: Early life, Career, Notable work/projects, Personal life, Legacy
- Organizations: History, Projects/Activities, Structure, Impact
- Concepts: Origin, Description, Usage/Application, Significance, Reception
- Artworks: Creation/Development, Description, Exhibition/Release, Reception, Legacy
- Events: Background, The event, Aftermath, Significance
- NFT Collections: Development, Launch, Design/Features, Community, Impact]

==History== OR ==Background== OR ==Origin==
[Narrative prose describing the historical development, background, or origin of the subject. Use the heading that best fits your subject.]<ref>[Citation for specific factual claims about dates, events, or actions.]</ref> 

[Write in clear, flowing prose. Avoid bullet points unless listing discrete items where a list genuinely improves readability.]

[If this section becomes very long (more than 4-5 paragraphs), consider sub-headings like ===Early development=== and ===Later developments===.]

==Description== OR ==Features== OR ==Design==
[Detailed description of what the subject is, how it functions, or what it consists of, written in clear prose.]<ref>[Citation for specific technical details or claims that require verification.]</ref>

[Common knowledge and general background do not require citations. Focus citations on specific claims about your subject.]

[AI: If the article discusses mathematical topics, use the Math extension to format formulas: <math>E=mc^2</math>. The wiki uses Native MathML rendering.]

[AI: If the article includes source code, use the SyntaxHighlight extension: <syntaxhighlight lang="python">print("Hello, world!")</syntaxhighlight>.]

[AI: If the article includes poetry or lyrics, use the Poem extension: <poem>Line 1
Line 2</poem>.]

[AI: If the article includes video embeds, use the EmbedVideo extension: {{#ev:youtube|VIDEO_ID|description=Caption}}. Supported services include youtube, vimeo, twitch, and others.]

[AI: If the article needs tabbed content, use the TabberNeue extension:
<tabber>
|-|Tab 1=
Content for first tab
|-|Tab 2=
Content for second tab
</tabber>]

==Significance== OR ==Impact== OR ==Influence==
[Section discussing the subject's importance, influence, or impact in a measured, encyclopedic tone. Not every subject needs this section - use judgment.]<ref>[Citation for claims of significance, influence, or reception.]</ref>

[Avoid promotional language. State impact factually and cite specific examples.]

==Reception== OR ==Critical response==
[If applicable: how the subject has been received by critics, audiences, or relevant communities.]<ref>[Citation for critical commentary or reception.]</ref>

[Only include if there is actual documented reception. Do not speculate about reception without sources.]

==Legacy== OR ==Later influence==
[If applicable: lasting impact or influence of the subject. Only include if the subject has had time to develop a legacy worth discussing.]<ref>[Citation for legacy claims.]</ref>

[Many subjects are too recent for a legacy section. Use judgment.]
