CATEGORY REFERENCE FOR REMILIA WIKI
====================================
This file provides standard categories for articles on the Remilia wiki.
Use these categories to ensure consistent article organization.
Less is more - prefer general categories over highly specific ones.

Last updated: December 31, 2025

====================================
NAVIGATION PHILOSOPHY
====================================

The Remilia Wiki uses a dual navigation system:

1. CATEGORIES (this file): Broad taxonomic groupings for browsing (2-4 per article)
2. NAVBOXES: Granular thematic navigation for related article clusters (5+ articles)

The wiki's conceptual organization follows this structure:
• Remilia Root - Core organizational content
• Projects - NFT collections, creative initiatives, experiments
• Publications & Media - Written works, videos, podcasts
• People & Personae - Individuals, clones, collective identities
• Ideas & Concepts - Philosophical frameworks, theoretical constructs
• Events & History - Exhibitions, moments, milestones
• Brands & Institutions - Organizations, collectives, scenes
• Artifacts & Objects - Discrete cultural productions

IMPORTANT: Categories should remain simple and broad. The navigation structure above
represents conceptual relationships that are better served by article content, internal
links, and navboxes rather than proliferating narrow categories.

====================================
CANONICAL CATEGORIES (11 total)

The wiki uses ONLY these 11 categories. Do not create or use others.

====================================
CATEGORY CREATION GUIDELINES
====================================

WHEN TO CREATE NEW CATEGORIES:
- You have 5+ articles that clearly belong together under a natural grouping
- The existing 11 categories are genuinely insufficient
- A clear, natural classification emerges organically from multiple articles
- Get approval from wiki admins before creating new categories

WHEN NOT TO CREATE NEW CATEGORIES:
- For a single article (use existing broader categories instead)
- For overly narrow classifications that fragment the wiki
- For temporary or one-off phenomena without lasting significance
- When an existing category already serves the purpose adequately
- To prove notability or importance of a subject

Examples of invalid categories to avoid:
- [[Category:Vulture Revisionism Cases]] (too specific, one concept)
- [[Category:2021 NFT Launches]] (overly granular temporal categorization)
- [[Category:Charlotte Fang Projects]] (redundant with [[Category:Remilia]])
- [[Category:Eating Disorder Concepts]] (too narrow, just use Ideas and Concepts)

AI GUIDANCE:
- DO NOT create new categories in your articles unless explicitly instructed
- ONLY use the 11 categories listed in this reference file
- If you believe a new category is needed, note it for human editors to consider
- Prefer using 2-3 existing categories over creating 1 new specific category

====================================
AVOIDING COMMON MISTAKES
====================================

DO NOT:
- Create new categories for single concepts or articles
- Use overly specific categories (e.g., "Vulture Revisionism Cases")
- Guess or hallucinate category names
- Add red links (non-existent categories) to articles
- Over-categorize - stick to 2-4 categories per article

DO:
- Use 2-4 categories from this reference file
- Choose the most specific applicable category when multiple options exist
- Keep categorization simple and navigable
- Focus on broad, useful groupings rather than exhaustive classification
- Remember [[Category:Remilia]] for Remilia-related content
- Use [[Category:Ideas and Concepts]] for theoretical frameworks and concepts

====================================
QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST
====================================

When categorizing an article, ask yourself:

1. Is it Remilia-related? → Add [[Category:Remilia]]

2. What type of content is it?
   - NFT Collection → [[Category:NFT Collections]]
   - Person → [[Category:People]]
   - Organization → [[Category:Organizations]]
   - Theory/Concept → [[Category:Ideas and Concepts]]
   - Cultural phenomenon → [[Category:Internet Culture]]
   - Exhibition → [[Category:Exhibitions]]
   - Event/Rave → [[Category:Events]]
   - Controversy/Cancel → [[Category:Cancels and Controversies]]

3. Does it relate to specific contexts?
   - Core New Net Art theory? → Add [[Category:New Net Art]]
   - Internet/digital art movement? → Maybe [[Category:Digital Art Movements]]

4. Total categories should be 2-4. Remove redundant categories.
