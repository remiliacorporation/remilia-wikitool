AI WRITING GUIDE: PITFALLS TO AVOID (BASED ON WIKIPEDIA MOS)

This guide outlines common writing patterns and formatting mistakes that are signs of AI generation.
To produce high-quality, human-like, and encyclopedic articles, you must strictly avoid all of the following:

---
I. CONTENT AND TONE
---

* **Avoid "Regression to the Mean":**
    * DO NOT replace specific, nuanced facts with generic, positive descriptions.
    * DO NOT exaggerate a subject's importance while being vague about their actual accomplishments.
    * [cite_start]BAD: "a revolutionary titan of industry" [cite: 41]
    * [cite_start]GOOD: "invented the first train-coupling device" [cite: 41]

* **Avoid Undue Emphasis on Symbolism:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT add superficial statements about how arbitrary or mundane aspects of a topic represent broader themes.
[cite: 47]
    * [cite_start]AVOID PHRASES: "stands as a symbol of" [cite: 49][cite_start], "reflects the evolving identity" [cite: 49][cite_start], "plays a significant role" [cite: 47][cite_start], "contributing to ecological balance" [cite: 47, 48][cite_start], "underscores its importance" [cite: 47][cite_start], "deeply rooted" [cite: 47][cite_start], "profound heritage"[cite: 47].

* **Avoid "Proving" Notability:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT write claims of notability into the article prose.
[cite: 50]
    * [cite_start]DO NOT list news outlets in the body text to prove the subject has coverage.
[cite: 50, 52]
    * [cite_start]AVOID PHRASES: "independent coverage" [cite: 52, 54][cite_start], "featured in several media outlets" [cite: 52][cite_start], "profiled in multiple national outlets" [cite: 52][cite_start], "Trade coverage has noted..." [cite: 54]
    * [cite_start]DO NOT attribute uncontroversial facts in the prose (e.g., "According to filings at Companies House...").
[cite: 55] Use an inline `<ref>...<ref>` citation instead.

* **Avoid Superficial Analyses:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT attach superficial analysis to the end of sentences, especially using present participle ("-ing") phrases.
[cite: 57]
    * [cite_start]DO NOT have inanimate objects (like "a fact," "an event," or "a monument") perform actions like "highlighting," "emphasizing," or "underscoring."
[cite: 59, 60]
    * [cite_start]AVOID PHRASES: "further enhancing its significance" [cite: 63][cite_start], "illustrate... lasting influence" [cite: 63][cite_start], "highlighting..." [cite: 57, 63][cite_start], "emphasizing the importance of" [cite: 57, 64][cite_start], "underscores its role" [cite: 57, 64][cite_start], "showcasing..." [cite: 57]

* **Avoid Promotional and Loaded Language (Puffery):**
    * [cite_start]You MUST maintain a neutral, encyclopedic tone.
[cite: 66]
    * [cite_start]AVOID PHRASES: "rich/vibrant/diverse tapestry" [cite: 65, 67, 69][cite_start], "cultural landscape" [cite: 65, 116][cite_start], "boasts a" [cite: 65][cite_start], "continues to captivate" [cite: 65][cite_start], "groundbreaking" [cite: 65, 117][cite_start], "stunning natural beauty" [cite: 65][cite_start], "enduring/lasting legacy" [cite: 65][cite_start], "nestled" [cite: 65, 68][cite_start], "in the heart of" [cite: 65][cite_start], "scenic landscapes" [cite: 69][cite_start], "fascinating glimpse"[cite: 69].

* **Avoid Didactic Disclaimers:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT address the reader directly with disclaimers or instructional phrases.
[cite: 73]
    * [cite_start]AVOID PHRASES: "it's important to note/remember" [cite: 73, 75][cite_start], "it is crucial to differentiate" [cite: 74][cite_start], or statements that something "may vary."
[cite: 74, 75]

* **Avoid Section Summaries and Conclusions:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT add a "Conclusion" section to an article.
[cite: 76]
    * [cite_start]DO NOT end sections with summary paragraphs starting with "In summary," "In conclusion," or "Overall."
[cite: 76, 78]

* **Avoid Formulaic "Challenges" Sections:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT use a rigid formula for "Challenges" or "Future Outlook" sections.
[cite: 79, 80]
    * [cite_start]AVOID THE PATTERN: "Despite its [success/prosperity], [article subject] faces challenges..." followed by vague, positive speculation about the future.
[cite: 79, 81, 82]

* **Avoid Misleading Leads for Lists/Broad Topics:**
    * [cite_start]When writing a lead for a list or a broad topic, DO NOT treat the article's title as if it were a proper noun or a real-world entity.
[cite: 84]
    * [cite_start]INCORRECT: `"'List of songs about Mexico' is a curated compilation..."` [cite: 86]
    * [cite_start]INCORRECT: `"'The Effects of Foreign language anxiety on Learning' refers to..."` [cite: 86]

* **Avoid Over-Citation (Unnatural Citation Density):**
    * DO NOT cite every sentence or every paragraph, especially for general background information.
    * DO NOT cite common knowledge or uncontroversial context that any knowledgeable person would know.
    * DO NOT pile multiple citations onto a single unremarkable sentence.
    * FOCUS citations on: direct claims about the specific subject, quotations, controversial claims, statistics, reception claims
    * INCORRECT: A paragraph with 5+ citations on basic contextual information
    * INCORRECT: "NFTs are digital tokens.<ref>1</ref> They are recorded on blockchains.<ref>2</ref> Ethereum is a blockchain platform.<ref>3</ref>"
    * CORRECT: "NFTs are digital tokens recorded on blockchains. Milady Maker launched on Ethereum in August 2021.<ref>1</ref>"
    * TARGET: Aim for 2-5 citations in a typical short article (2-4 paragraphs), focusing on the most important verifiable claims
    * This is especially important for subcultural wikis documenting internet phenomena - excessive academic citations are a telltale sign of AI writing

---
II. LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR
---

* **Avoid Negative Parallelisms:**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT use argumentative or non-neutral constructions like "Not only... but..." or "It is not just about... it's..." [cite: 87, 88]

* **Avoid the "Rule of Three":**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT overuse the "rule of three" (e.g., "adjective, adjective, adjective" or "keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities") as a substitute for specific detail.
[cite: 101, 102, 104]

* **Avoid Vague Attributions (Weasel Words):**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT attribute opinions to vague, undefined groups.

[cite: 108]

* **Avoid "Elegant Variation":**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT strain to find synonyms for a subject (e.g., "the protagonist," "the key player," "the non-conformist artists," "these artists," "like-minded artists," "Russian avant-garde artists").
[cite: 109, 112, 114, 116, 117]
    * It is better to use the subject's name or a simple pronoun (`he`, `she`, `they`, `it`) consistently.

* **Avoid "False Ranges":**
    * [cite_start]DO NOT use "from... to..." constructions unless they describe a real, meaningful, and continuous scale (e.g., "from 1990 to 2000," "from mild to severe").
[cite: 118, 119]
    * [cite_start]DO NOT create "false ranges" using unrelated endpoints to sound impressive.
[cite: 124, 125]
