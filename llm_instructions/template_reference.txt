TEMPLATE REFERENCE FOR REMILIA WIKI
=====================================
This file provides a quick reference to all available MediaWiki templates.
Consult this when writing articles to know which templates are available.

Last updated: December 25, 2025
MediaWiki version: 1.44.0

=====================================
MODULE ARCHITECTURE (December 2025)
=====================================

The wiki's templates now use a module-based architecture with Lua (Scribunto)
and TemplateStyles for consistent styling and dark mode support.

TEMPLATE MODULES:
- Module:Message - Message boxes, stubs, quality banners, inline tags
- Module:Hatnote - Hatnotes, disambiguation, navigation links
- Module:Quotation - Blockquotes, pull quotes, poetry
- Module:Navbox - Navigation boxes, horizontal lists
- Module:Sidebar - Sidebars, portals
- Module:Format - Abbreviations, nowrap, language markup, etc.
- Module:Repost - External article reposts (Mirror.xyz, Paragraph.com, etc.)
- Module:Reference - Reference lists, bibliographies, footnotes
- Module:Blockchain - Blockchain explorer links (Etherscan, OpenSea, etc.)
- Module:Infobox - All infobox templates (existing)
- Module:Citation - All citation templates (existing)
- Module:D3Chart - Data visualization charts (existing)
- Module:Age - Date calculations (existing)

DARK MODE SUPPORT:
All module-based templates use CSS classes instead of inline styles.
This enables proper dark mode support via the wiki's [data-theme="dark"] toggle.
Templates automatically adapt to both light and dark themes.

TEMPLATESTYLES:
Each module has an accompanying /styles.css page with scoped CSS.
Templates automatically load their styles via <templatestyles src="..."/>.

For template developers: See custom/templates/ in the repository for
the Lua source files and CSS stylesheets.

=====================================
QUICK START FOR AI
=====================================

Every article must have:
1. {{SHORTDESC:...}} (line 1) - uses the ShortDescription extension magic word
2. {{Article quality|unverified}} (line 2) - MANDATORY
3. Blank line (line 3)
4. Article body starting with '''bold title''' (line 4)
5. Infobox or lead image
6. Inline citations using {{Cite web}}, {{Cite tweet}}, etc.
7. {{Reflist}} in ==References== section
8. 2-4 [[Category:...]] tags

CRITICAL ARCHIVAL RULE:
Leave ALL archive fields blank (archive-url, archive-is, archive-date, screenshot).
Human editors will complete these manually later.

CRITICAL AI RESTRICTIONS:
Never use {{Citation needed}} or {{When}} - cite properly or search for sources.
Never use {{Article quality|wip}} or {{Article quality|verified}} - only humans can change status.
If you cannot find a source, do not make the claim.

For full details, see sections below.

=====================================
MOS TEXT FORMATTING
=====================================

{{lang|language code|text}}
Purpose: Identifies non-English words/phrases for accessibility and semantic markup (required by MoS)
Key params: language code (ISO 639: fr, de, ja, etc.), text to mark
Example: The term {{lang|fr|déjà vu}} appears frequently.
Example: {{lang|ja|カワイイ}} (kawaii) culture influenced the aesthetic.
Note: Required for ALL non-English text. Proper names typically don't need this.

{{block indent|text}}
Purpose: Indents text blocks without quotation formatting (MoS forbids colon indentation in articles)
Key params: text to indent, em (optional width in em units, default: 2)
Example: {{block indent|This paragraph will be indented without quotation styling.}}
Note: Use for indented text that is NOT a quotation. For quotations, use {{Blockquote}}.

{{'s}}
Purpose: Formats possessive 's after italicized text
Placement: Immediately after closing italics markup
Example: ''Milady Maker''{{'s}} impact on digital culture...
Example: ''The New York Times''{{'s}} coverage of the movement...
Note: Prevents formatting issues with wikitext apostrophes after italics.

{{`}}
Purpose: Formats apostrophes after italicized text (non-possessive)
Placement: Immediately after closing italics markup
Example: The ''Iliad''{{'}}, written by Homer...
Example: ''Remilia''{{'}}, work continues to evolve.
Note: For possessive 's, use {{'s}} instead.

{{IPA|pronunciation}}
Purpose: Formats International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciations (required by MoS)
Key params: IPA transcription (without slashes - template adds them)
Example: Remilia {{IPA|rɪˈmɪliə}}
Example: The term is pronounced {{IPA|ˈmiːmi}}.
Note: Use broad transcriptions. See MoS pronunciation guidelines.

{{Math|expression}}
Purpose: Formats inline mathematical expressions with proper styling
Module: Module:Format (math function)
Key params: Mathematical expression (italicize variables with ''var'')
Example: The equation {{Math|''E'' = ''mc''²}} shows mass-energy equivalence.
Note: For block equations, use <math>...</math> tags instead. The wiki uses Native MathML rendering.

{{Refbegin}}
Purpose: Starts formatted reference list with hanging indents (for "Further reading" or "External links")
Module: Module:Reference (refbegin function)
Placement: Before first item, paired with {{Refend}}
Key params: 1 (columns), colwidth, indent, liststyle
Example: {{Refbegin}}
* Author, A. (2020). ''Book Title''. Publisher.
{{Refend}}
Example: {{Refbegin|2}} for two columns

{{Refend}}
Purpose: Closes formatted reference list started with {{Refbegin}}
Module: Module:Reference (refend function)
Placement: After last item in reference list
Note: Always pair with {{Refbegin}}

{{Efn|note text}}
Purpose: Explanatory footnote separate from citations (displays as [a], [b], [c])
Module: Module:Reference (efn function)
Placement: After statement needing explanation
Key params: 1 (note text), name, group
Requires: ==Notes== section with {{Reflist|group=note}} before ==References==
Example: The project launched in March.{{Efn|Some sources cite February.}}

=====================================
CITATION TEMPLATES
=====================================

AUTHOR HANDLING:
All citation templates automatically adjust their format based on whether an author is present:
- With author: Author (date). "Title"...
- Without author: Date. "Title"...
This ensures clean, Wikipedia-style formatting in both cases.

NAMED REFERENCES (Repeated Citations):
When the same source is cited multiple times, use MediaWiki's named reference system to avoid duplication.

Syntax:
First use: <ref name="shortname">{{Cite template|...}}</ref>
Subsequent uses: <ref name="shortname" />

Example:
<ref name="decrypt2022">{{Cite web|author=Tim Copeland|date=May 19, 2022|title=Milady NFT Prices Tank|url=https://decrypt.co/100820/milady-nft-prices-tank|work=Decrypt}}</ref>
...later in article...
<ref name="decrypt2022" />

Best practices:
- Use author+year naming convention (e.g., "fang2023", "vice2021")
- For multiple works by same author/year, add letter suffix (e.g., "fang2023a")
- Keep names lowercase, no spaces
- The full citation appears only once in References section

{{Cite web}}
Purpose: General web sources with archive support
Key params: url, title, last, first, date, website, access-date, archive-url, archive-date, archive-is, archive-is-date, screenshot
Output format (with author): Last, First (date). "Title". Website. Retrieved date. Archived at Wayback Machine on date. Archived at archive.today on date.
Output format (without author): Date. "Title". Website. Retrieved date. Archived at Wayback Machine on date. Archived at archive.today on date.
Example: {{Cite web|url=https://example.com|title=Article Title|last=Smith|first=John|date=June 1, 2021|website=Example News|access-date=October 31, 2025}}
Example (no author): {{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_Fairy|title=Bottle Fairy|website=Wikipedia|access-date=November 5, 2025}}

{{Cite post}}
Purpose: Substack, Mirror, Medium, and blog posts
Key params: author (or last/first), date, title, blog, publisher, type, url, access-date, archive-url, archive-date, archive-is, archive-is-date, screenshot, repost-at
Output format (with author): Author (date). "Title". Blog. Publisher [Type]. Retrieved date. Archived at Wayback Machine on date. Archived at archive.today on date. Reposted at [[Wiki page]].
Output format (without author): Date. "Title". Blog. Publisher [Type]. Retrieved date. Archived at Wayback Machine on date. Archived at archive.today on date. Reposted at [[Wiki page]].
Example: {{Cite post|author=Charlotte Fang|date=April 20, 2022|title=New Net Art Manifesto|blog=Golden Light|publisher=Mirror|type=Essay}}
Example (no author): {{Cite post|date=September 2021|title=Milady Maker: Notes on the Design Process|blog=Remilia Corporation Blog|url=https://blog.remilia.org/milady-maker/}}
Example (with repost): {{Cite post|author=Charlotte Fang|date=September 2, 2023|title=Dynasty Mindset|url=https://goldenlight.mirror.xyz/...|blog=Golden Light|publisher=Mirror|type=Essay|access-date=November 6, 2025|repost-at=Goldenlight:Dynasty Mindset}}
Note: Use for authored long-form content on platforms. Use {{Cite web}} for general websites.

REPOST-AT PARAMETER USAGE:
The |repost-at= parameter links to a wiki page where the full content has been transcribed.

APPROPRIATE for reposting:
- goldenlight Mirror essays (Remilia-affiliated primary sources)
- Substack posts by Remilia members/community
- Personal blog posts by Remilia affiliates about Remilia topics
- Self-published essays explicitly about Remilia
- Community member writings with implied consent

NOT appropriate for reposting:
- Third-party commercial blog content
- Paywalled Substack content by non-affiliated authors
- Professional journalism (use {{Cite news}} instead)
- Content where copyright/permission is unclear

The wiki preserves primary source material by and about its subject (Remilia Corporation), not commercial third-party content. For goldenlight specifically: As Charlotte Fang's personal Mirror documenting Remilia's development, and given Remilia's post-authorship principles, there is a strong argument for implied consent to preserve these foundational texts on the Remilia wiki.

{{Cite tweet}}
Purpose: Twitter/X posts - ALWAYS include archive fields for manual completion
Key params: user, author, date, tweet, url, access-date, archive-url, archive-date, archive-is, archive-is-date, screenshot, repost-at
Output format: @user (Author) (date). "Tweet text". Tweet. Retrieved date. Archived at Wayback Machine on date. Archived at archive.today on date. Reposted at [[Wiki page]].
Example: {{Cite tweet|user=angelicism01|date=June 6, 2021|tweet=The Great VIBE SHIFT|url=https://twitter.com/...}}
Note: Triple archival (archive.org + archive.is + screenshot) recommended for ephemeral content.

TWEET TEXT FORMATTING:
Always include the complete tweet text exactly as it appears on Twitter/X, preserving the author's original formatting.

Key principle: Copy exactly what you see on Twitter/X
- Open the tweet on Twitter/X and copy the text
- Preserve all original line breaks, paragraph structure, and spacing
- Do NOT add formatting that wasn't in the original
- Do NOT remove formatting that was in the original
- Line breaks and paragraph structure are meaningful stylistic choices that convey emphasis, pacing, or logical separation

Formatting examples:

Single-paragraph tweets (no line breaks in original):
- Keep as one continuous line
- Example: |tweet=The Great VIBE SHIFT, 1-5 June 2021. Where were you?

Multi-paragraph tweets (line breaks in original):
- Preserve all original line breaks and blank lines exactly
- Example: |tweet=Cute is the face of Cthulhu, it's not going away.

The history of aesthetics' subsumption into industrial capitalism has been all driving towards a refined cuteness...

Tweets with lists or special formatting:
- Maintain the author's original structure (numbered lists, bullet points, etc.)
- Preserve their spacing and layout choices

Multi-tweet threads:
- Each tweet in a thread gets its own separate citation
- Include full text of each tweet with original formatting
- Create separate {{Cite tweet}} for each tweet with its unique URL

Best practice workflow:
1. Open the tweet on Twitter/X
2. Copy the text exactly as displayed
3. Paste into |tweet= parameter
4. Don't modify the formatting
5. Fill in other parameters (user, date, url, etc.)

Managing large reference sections:
When including full tweet text makes your references section long, use multi-column layout:
- {{Reflist|2}} for two-column layout
- {{Reflist|30em}} for adaptive column width

REPOST-AT PARAMETER USAGE:
The |repost-at= parameter should be used SPARINGLY for tweets - only for significant multi-tweet threads by Remilia members that form cohesive essays.

RARELY APPROPRIATE - use sparingly:
- Significant multi-tweet threads by Remilia members that form cohesive essays
- Foundational tweets that are frequently referenced and at high risk of deletion
- Tweet threads that provide essential context/explanation not available elsewhere

NOT appropriate for:
- Single tweets (screenshot is sufficient)
- Casual tweets without lasting significance
- Tweets by non-affiliated accounts (screenshot only)
- Any tweet where screenshot + archive links are sufficient

For most tweets, the existing triple-archive system (archive.org + archive.is + screenshot) is sufficient.

{{Cite interview}}
Purpose: Interviews in any format (print, audio, video, web)
Key params: last, first (or author), interviewer, title, date, work, publisher, medium, url, access-date, archive-url, archive-date, archive-is, archive-is-date, screenshot
Output format: Last, First (interviewee) (date). Interview with Interviewer. "Title". Work. [Medium interview]. Link. Retrieved date.
Example: {{Cite interview|last=Fang|first=Charlotte|interviewer=John Smith|title=Digital Art Future|work=Art Forum|date=March 15, 2022|url=https://example.com}}

{{Efn|Explanatory note text}}
Purpose: Explanatory footnotes separate from citations (not for sources)
Display: Shows as [a], [b], [c] instead of [1], [2], [3]
Requires: ==Notes== section with {{Reflist|group=note}} before ==References== section
Example: The project launched in August{{Efn|Some sources cite late July, but the official announcement was August 1.}} to immediate success.

TEXT FORMATTING
=====================================

{{SHORTDESC: Brief one-line description}}
Purpose: Article metadata (search, mobile, previews) - uses ShortDescription extension magic word
Placement: FIRST line of every article
Example: {{SHORTDESC:Contemporary digital art movement}}
Note: This is a parser function/magic word, not a template. It sets metadata for search results, mobile views, and page previews.

{{Birth date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}}
Purpose: Displays birth date and automatically calculates current age
Key params: 1=year, 2=month (1-12), 3=day (1-31)
Placement: In {{Infobox person}} birth_date parameter
Output: January 25, 1997 (age 28) [age updates automatically]
Example: {{Infobox person|birth_date={{Birth date and age|1997|1|25}}}}
Note: ONLY use for non-pseudonymous individuals with publicly documented birth dates. Most Remilia figures operate pseudonymously - do NOT use this template for personas like "Charlotte Fang" (the persona). MAY use for legal identities like "Krishna Okhandiar" if birth date is publicly documented and relevant.
When NOT to use:
- Pseudonymous figures (like Charlotte Fang as a persona)
- When birth date is not publicly available or verified
- When privacy concerns exist
- For approximate/unverified dates (just write "born circa 1997")
Decision tree:
1. Is this person operating under their legal name? → Consider using
2. Is the birth date publicly documented in reliable sources? → May use
3. Is the person a public figure where age is relevant? → May use
4. Otherwise → Omit birth date entirely or use approximate language

{{As of|2025|October}}
Purpose: Marks temporal statements
Example: {{As of|2025}}, the project has 10,000 participants.

{{Circa|1997}}
Purpose: Approximate dates
Example: Charlotte Fang (born {{Circa|1997}})

{{Abbr|NFT|Non-Fungible Token}}
Purpose: Abbreviations with tooltips
Example: The {{Abbr|DAO|Decentralized Autonomous Organization}} structure...

{{Nowrap|text to keep together}}
Purpose: Prevents line breaks
Example: {{Nowrap|10,000 ETH}}

{{Em|text}}
Purpose: Emphasis (italics)
Example: The project was {{Em|not}} about commercial success.

{{Sic}}
Purpose: Marks errors in quoted material
Placement: Immediately after error in quote
Example: "The phenonmenon{{Sic}} is widespread."

{{Anchor|anchor_name}}
Purpose: Creates invisible anchor for linking
Example: ==History==
{{Anchor|Background}}

{{When|date=Month Year|reason=explanation}}
Purpose: Marks vague temporal statements needing specific dates (maintenance tag)
Placement: Immediately after vague time reference
Example: The project launched recently{{When|date=November 2025}}.
**AI MUST NEVER USE THIS** - Always find and use specific dates. If you cannot find a specific date, use {{Circa}} or omit the vague reference entirely. This template is for human editors marking existing vague content only.

=====================================
MEDIA & GALLERIES
=====================================

{{Gallery|content}}
Purpose: Creates responsive image gallery with captions
Module: Module:Format (gallery function)

Example: {{SHORTDESC:...}}
{{Article quality|unverified}}

'''Article title''' begins here...
**AI MUST ALWAYS USE THIS** - Every AI-generated article requires this template on line 2.
Note: This template serves two purposes: (1) warns readers about potential inaccuracies, (2) helps editors identify articles needing fact-checking.

{{Article quality|wip}}
Purpose: Marks articles under manual revision that may still contain errors
Module: Module:Message (quality function)
Placement: Same as unverified (line 2)
Display: Blue banner with "Work in progress" message

Note: Used when an editor is actively fact-checking and revising an AI-generated article.

{{Article quality|verified}}
Purpose: Marks human-verified, fact-checked articles
Module: Module:Message (quality function)
Placement: Same as unverified (line 2)
Display: INVISIBLE to readers (hidden marker detectable by LLMs via data-quality="verified" attribute)
Key params: 1/level=verified (required)
**AI MUST NEVER USE THIS** - Only human editors can mark articles as verified after thorough fact-checking.

=====================================
MAINTENANCE TEMPLATES
=====================================

NOTE: Maintenance templates now use Module:Message with TemplateStyles.
They support dark mode and use semantic CSS classes.

{{Citation needed|date=Month Year}}
Purpose: Flags unsourced statements requiring citations
Module: Module:Message (cn function)
Placement: Immediately after unsourced claim, before punctuation
Key params: date (Month Year format), reason (optional explanation)
Example: The project raised over $1 million.{{Citation needed|date=December 2025}}

**AI MUST NEVER USE THIS** - All AI-generated content must be properly cited. If you cannot find a source for a claim, do not make the claim. Use your web search tools to find reliable sources. This template is for human editors marking existing uncited content only.

{{Clarify|date=Month Year|reason=explanation}}
Purpose: Marks unclear text needing clarification
Module: Module:Message (clarify function)
Placement: Immediately after unclear statement
Key params: date (Month Year), reason (optional explanation)
Example: The thing happened somehow.{{Clarify|date=December 2025}}
**AI MUST NEVER USE THIS** - Write clearly. This is for human editors.

{{Stub|type}}
Purpose: Marks short articles needing expansion
Module: Module:Message (stub function)
Placement: At end of article, before categories
Key params: 1/type=stub category (e.g., "person", "NFT")
Example: {{Stub}}

Purpose: Marks content containing outdated information
Module: Module:Message (update function, inline tag)
Placement: After specific outdated statement
Key params: date (Month Year), reason (what needs updating)

Note: Supports MoS guidance to avoid "current" and use specific dates.

{{Ambox|type=notice|text=Message text}}
Purpose: Article message box for various notices
Module: Module:Message (ambox function)
Placement: At top of article or section
Key params: type (notice/warning/serious/content/style/delete/protection), text, image, imagesize, small
Example: {{Ambox|type=warning|text=This article's accuracy is disputed.}}
Note: For structured notices. Supports dark mode.

=====================================
ARCHIVAL REQUIREMENTS
=====================================

CRITICAL: Leave ALL archive fields blank in AI-generated articles.
Human editors will complete these manually later.

Archive parameters (AI must leave blank):
- archive-url, archive-date (Wayback Machine / archive.org)
- archive-is, archive-is-date (archive.today / archive.is)
- screenshot (local file upload for images of web content)

Available in these citation templates:
- {{Cite web}}, {{Cite post}}, {{Cite tweet}}, {{Cite interview}}
- {{Cite message}}, {{Cite news}}, {{Cite book}}, {{Cite video}}

SPECIAL CASE - {{Cite message}}:
Discord and Telegram citations REQUIRE the screenshot parameter because:
- Message links break when servers/channels are deleted
- Message links require authentication (not publicly accessible)
- Screenshots provide permanent, verifiable records

However, AI should still leave the screenshot parameter blank (or with placeholder text) for manual file upload by human editors.

Example of correct AI output for Discord citation:
{{Cite message|user=Username|date=October 2023|message=Message text here|server=Server Name|channel=channel-name|platform=Discord|screenshot=}}

Archival best practices for human editors:
- Twitter/X: Triple archival recommended (archive.org + archive.is + screenshot)
- News articles: Dual archival recommended (archive.org + archive.is)
- Discord/Telegram: Screenshot required, archive links optional
- General web: At minimum one archive (archive.org or archive.is)

=====================================
USAGE NOTES
=====================================

NON-ENGLISH TEXT:
- ALL non-English words/phrases must use {{lang|code|text}}
- Use ISO 639 language codes (fr, de, es, ja, zh, etc.)
- Applies even to common loanwords if they retain foreign spelling
- Exception: Proper names in other languages typically don't need {{lang}}

REMILIA-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- Use parent_group instead of creator/artist for Remilia projects (honors post-authorship)
- Discuss individual contributors in article body, not infoboxes
- Use organizer instead of curator for Remilia exhibitions
- For NFT collections: Always include {{Etherscan}} link in External links section
- For biographical articles: Only use {{Birth date and age}} for non-pseudonymous individuals

CITATION TYPE SELECTION:
- {{Cite web}} → General websites, news sites, institutional pages
- {{Cite post}} → Substack, Mirror, Medium, personal blogs (supports |repost-at= for Remilia-affiliated primary sources)
- {{Cite tweet}} → Twitter/X posts (archive fields for manual completion; |repost-at= for significant threads only)
- {{Cite interview}} → Interviews in any format (print, audio, video, web)
- {{Cite message}} → Discord, Telegram, group chats (screenshot required)
- {{Cite news}} → Newspaper and magazine articles
- {{Cite video}} → YouTube, podcasts, video content
- {{Cite book}} → Books (print or online)
- {{Cite journal}} → Academic journal articles

MAINTENANCE TAGS (FOR HUMAN EDITORS ONLY):
- AI MUST NEVER use {{Citation needed}} - all AI-generated content must be cited
- AI MUST NEVER use {{When}} - always find and use specific dates instead
- AI should not intentionally create {{Stub}} articles - write complete articles
- {{Update}} may be used if explicitly expanding an outdated existing article
- Always include date parameters for proper categorization

CITATION WORKFLOW:
1. Find reliable source via web search
2. Use appropriate {{Cite...}} template
3. Place <ref>{{Cite...}}</ref> immediately after fact
4. Add {{Reflist}} in ==References== section
5. Leave archive fields blank (archive-url, archive-date, archive-is, archive-is-date, screenshot) - for manual completion by human editors later

EVERY ARTICLE MUST HAVE:
1. Line 1: {{SHORTDESC:...}}
2. Line 2: {{Article quality|unverified}} (MANDATORY for all AI-generated articles)
3. Line 3: (blank line)
4. Line 4: Article body begins with '''bold title'''
5. Proper infobox or lead image (place after short description, can be before or after article quality banner)
6. Well-structured prose (avoid excessive lists)
7. Inline citations for key claims (typically 2-5 for short articles)
8. ==References== section with {{Reflist}}
9. 2-4 [[Category:...]] tags at end (prefer categories from category_reference.txt)

NEVER USE:
- Markdown syntax (use wikitext)
- Curly quotes (use straight quotes)
- Title Case for headings (use Sentence case)
- Boldface for emphasis (use italics/{{Em}})
- Meta-commentary ("Here's a draft...", "I hope this helps")
- Colon indentation (`:`) in articles (use {{block indent}} instead)
- {{Citation needed}} in AI-generated content (cite everything properly)
- {{When}} in AI-generated content (find specific dates)
- {{Article quality|wip}} or {{Article quality|verified}} in AI-generated content (only humans can change status)
- Collapsible content in article prose (violates MoS)
